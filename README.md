Sample entropy for graph signals

This repository contains code for definition and experiments on 'Sample Entropy for graph signals' adapted from https://github.com/JohnFabila/PEG. Datasets and experiments for logistic maps, MIX, and weather stations can be found in the same repository.

Directed ER random graphs are generated using the implementation from https://github.com/preethamam/Random-Graphs-and-Trees with the MIT license included. Code for 1D sample entropy available at: https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69381-sample-entropy.

Images for the Brodatz dataset can be found in https://www.ux.uis.no/~tranden/brodatz.html. for
